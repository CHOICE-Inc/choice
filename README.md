# Goal Tracker CI

Goal Tracker CI is a full-stack web application that will allow the staff at Choice’s three locations to track the personal and professional goals of the participants in their day program services, while also providing data on goal completion over a set period of time. At the basic staff level, users will be able to enter morning and afternoon goal completion, view previous days’ entries, and mark a participant absent. Case managers will also be able to create and edit personalized goals for participants and review summary data for three month and six month periods in order to write reports. Location administrators will be able to manage staff, including add and delete staff accounts; manage participants, including adding and removing participants and assigning case managers; and managing job site information.
